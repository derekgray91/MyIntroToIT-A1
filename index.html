<h2>Personal Information</h2>

<p>Hi, I’m Derek and you’ve decided to have a look at my profile. I was born and raised in Sydney Australia, with a strong influence from my Italian heritage.One of my major regrets from my childhood is not taking the time to learn to speak Italian. This means that outside of a smattering of words and phrases here and there, the only language I can speak is English.</p>

<p>My past with studies has not been as complete as I would like it to have been. I dropped out of High School before completing my HSC, after which I joined the Australian Navy where I worked for nearly 10 years. After leaving I started working in the IT industry which has led me to beginning my studies with a Bachelor of IT.</p>

<p>My current hobby of choice is building, painting, and conducting large scale war on my friends with Warhammer miniatures. I have 3 different armies over the major versions of Warhammer. Below you’ll see a picture of my favourite painted mini to date, it took me just over 7 hours over 3 days from beginning to end.</p>

<h2>Interest in IT</h2>

<p>The beginnings of my interest in IT started at a young age with computer games mostly, however it didn’t really become a passion until I neared the end of my time in the Navy. The thing that really sparked a desire to know more about IT came in the form of hardware. I had a PC that I used for gaming which was beginning to get old, so I decided to delve into the world of hardware and begin to lay the foundation to build a new PC. My current IT experience has come from completing a certificate 4 in IT and on the job training I’ve received as a part of my current role.</p>

<p>I chose to study at RMIT due to a previous foray into a Bachelor during my time in the Navy and based on information provided to me by friends of mine who had studied there. All the information I had been provided indicated that RMIT was one of the best universities to study at if I wanted to complete a Bachelor of IT. </p>

<p>The biggest thing that I believe that I’m going to learn during my studies is just how little I know about IT. What I am very keen to learn however is more about programming. The small foray I’ve had into HTML and Python so far have sparked a desire to learn more inside my brain which.</p>

<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/58340059?type=standout#sol=3325f86c18bcd409db74f0fa280a83fdef08157d">My Ideal Role</a>
<img src="images/Ideal Job Posting.PNG" title="Screen Capture of my ideal job" alt="Screen Capture of my ideal job">

<p>This role is for a Game Design Director who works as a conduit between the CEO and design team to guide their work to produce games ready to be enjoyed. This appeals to me because it combines two aspects of my life, IT and gaming. </p>

<p>This role has an emphasis on the higher end level of game developing, even to the point of no longer specifically being on tools rather focusing on keeping the developer teams focused with goals and ensuring everything is kept on track. As such, essential skills for this role include prior experience in game development, a strong leadership ability and someone who has excellent communication skills. This role also has a high desire for an applicant with an in-depth knowledge of the Unreal and/or Unity engines, which is understandable</p>

<p>This is a role which is quite a way outside of my current experience. My time in the Australian Navy has provided me the opportunity to develop robust communication and leadership skills. As such, the path towards this role will take time, however completing my Bachelor is the first step towards gaining a greater understanding of IT and more specifically programming. After completing this a good step would be to investigate game design roles that are available, preferably something in the junior developer role to give me the opportunity to immerse myself in the development atmosphere.</p>

<h2>Personal Profile</h2>

<h3>Myers-Briggs Results</h3>
<img src="images/Myers_Briggs_Results.PNG" title="My Myers-Briggs test results" alt="My Myers-Briggs test results">

<p>The results of this test tell me that I am a self-confident person who is mildly introverted and is somewhat observant. This tells me that I may not necessarily be the best person to put forward into a leadership position as a part of a team. Taking this into account I would actively be seeking someone who is more extraverted and intuitive than I am to shore up some of the areas that I am not necessarily as strong in.</p>

<h3>Learning Style</h3>
<img src="images/Learning_Style.PNG" title="My learning style test results" alt="My learning style test results">

<p>This test confirms my prior thought of being a hands-on learner, however it is new that auditory is just as helpful to me. This suggests that in a team environment I’m likely to be more hands on with my learning, whilst also potentially listening along. Taking this into account when forming a team, it would benefit me to find other people who are similarly hands on, and people who are able to teach by providing those tactile options.</p>

<h3>Big 5 Personality Test</h3>
<img src="images/Big_5_Test.PNG" title="The results of doing the Big 5 Personality test" alt="The results of doing the Big 5 Personality test">

<p>This test helps to solidify results from the Myers-Briggs test by echoing roughly the same level of introversion. Having a decent level of conscientiousness and agreeableness would likely mean I would end up in a position of being a diplomatic role within the team. These same traits however may mean that it is more uncomfortable for me to be the bearer or bad news, which again echoes my thoughts previously that a leadership role may not necessarily be the best fit for me, at least currently.</p>

<h2>Project Idea</h2>

<h3>Project Overview</h3>
<p>I’d like to create a new website or page for the charity BrothersNBooks to use during their annual 5 Books in 50 days Read-A-Thon. This page would be used to allow participants to log the books they have read during the period, which would then collate with the lists their team has read and ultimately collate those lists into a master list which can be used to show numerous data points at the end of the read-a-thon to provide back to the community. Additionally, I would like to add in functionality to allow members to either write a short review, link to their amazon or good reads reviews, or both to allow other people reviewing to quickly decide whether it’s a book they’d enjoy.</p>

<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>Currently, BrothersNBooks website for their read-a-thon is essentially a GoFundMe page. This currently limits the functionality of the readers, and those who choose to donate to them, to create and showcase a list of the books they’ve read in an easy format. It is possible for them to write them in comments, but ultimately this is a somewhat clunky way of doing it and it gets lost down wherever the comments reside on the page. This is a passion project for me as BrothersNBooks actively use the money raised from these events to support Veterans and active serving defence members in Australia. This website won’t change the world, or even honestly be noticed by many, however any change that can be made could lead to somebody in need getting help would make it a worthwhile project to me.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The first element that would need to be created is the website itself. This would be created utilising a tool, Sublime Text in my case, in conjunction with GitHub to allow all contributors to access and work on the document as needed. The actual content of the webpage would likely be somewhat like the website currently being used on the BrothersNBooks webpages to ensure it fits in with their colour and style schemes.</p>
<p>Next up would be to create an input form section which would allow users to input details of the books reading. The fields here could be as simple as book title and author, or they could be made to be more complex, such as adding details like page length or a short review of the book. If we’re making this page to give BrothersNBooks data from which to present back to the community, a more complete or extensive input form would likely be the best to ensure relevant data is captured.</p>
<p>The third element would be some form of data capturing of all the information being input. This would be used to display the data on the user’s page to allow for viewing and editing by the person as needed. Outputs on the user page should be at the very least book title, author and either their short review or a link to their review being held on an external website, such as amazon or good reads. </p>

<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
<p>The main tools that will be required for this are very similar to this project. An application to write your code in, which could be any of a number such as Sublime Text, Atom or VSC. Utilising GitHub for a central depository and workspace for everyone involved would also be an extremely useful and integral part of this project. Utilising coding examples provided by W3 Schools will also be immensely helpful to ensure code for the input form sections are correctly input.</p>

<h3>Skills Required</h3>
<p>As outlined in my Tools and Technology many, if not all, of the skills required for this project are mirrored from this assessment. HTML code will be most of the skills required to complete this project at its most basic level. HTML CSS will be heavily used to ensure all the colours and styles utilised are in keeping with the current BrothersNBooks scheme on their website. Additionally, there would likely be a requirement to understand how to create an input form to allow users to input their books read into a list and allow that list to be viewed on their page. The skills needed for this are not difficult to find as everything could be accomplished with somewhat simple HTML coding experience and all the software required for this is able to be utilised for free and easily downloaded for use.</p>

<h3>Outcome</h3>
<p> The outcome of this project would allow users a space to list the books they’ve read throughout the 50 days of the read-a-thon. The hope is that other users will be able to view these lists and that it will spark either competition in them to read more books or spark some interest in them to read a particular book they have seen on another’s page. Ultimately the goal of this is to increase the visibility of books read in the hopes of donations being increased which would lead to more donations made by BrothersNBooks.</p>
